How to use this simulation code package?

Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 can be generated by directly running the "aperturelowN0.m" file. 
Fig. 10 and Fig.11 can be generated by directly running the "aperturelargeN0.m" file. 
Fig. 12 can be generated by directly running the Asymptotic-"asymptotic.m" file. 
Fig.13 can be generated by directly running the "powerlown0.m" file. 
Fig. 14 can be generated by directly running the "powerlargen0.m" file.
